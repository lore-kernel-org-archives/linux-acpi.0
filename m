So let's see:

        if (!*buf_paddr)
                return -ENOENT;

can happen when apei_read() has returned 0 but it has managed to do

	*val = 0;

Now, that function returns error values which we should be checking
but we're checking the buf_paddr pointed to value for being 0. Are
we fearing that even if acpi_os_read_memory() or acpi_os_read_port()
succeed, *buf_paddr could still be 0 ?

Because if not, we should be checking whether rc == -EINVAL and then
convert it to -ENOENT.

But ghes_read_estatus() handles the error case first *and* *then* checks
buf_paddr too, to make really really sure we won't be reading from
address 0.

Lemme get this straight: when we do

	apei_read(&buf_paddr, &g->error_status_address);

in the polled case, buf_paddr can be 0?

Yeah, OTOH, we shouldn't be pushing our luck here, I guess.

So let's sum up: we'll ack the GHES error in all but the -ENOENT cases
in order to free the memory occupied by the error record.

The slightly "pathological" -ENOENT case is I guess how the fw behaves
when it is being polled and also for broken firmware which could report
a 0 buf_paddr.

Btw, that last thing I'm assuming because

  d334a49113a4 ("ACPI, APEI, Generic Hardware Error Source memory error support")

doesn't say what that check was needed for.

Thx.
