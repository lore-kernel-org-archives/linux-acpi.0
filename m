One problem with the DMI-based approach is that _REV is constant in ACPICA,
so to be able to return different values from it for different systems, we'll
need to add some ACPICA-ish code handling that specifically for Linux and
we're a bit too late in the cycle for that.

So here's what I'm going to do.  I'll revert commit b1ef29725865 for 4.1,
but *only* for 4.1 (I've actually queued up a revert of it already) and
I'll revert that revert during the 4.2 merge window.

In the meantime, we'll develop the code to implement the DMI-based quirks
for the Dells and apply it for 4.2.

Are there any volunteers for doing the last part?
