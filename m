Thanks for the heads-up. I'm confused though that you're sending this
in reply to the thinkpad_helper.c patch, I assume this only concerns
the ASoC patch?

As you've correctly observed, acpi_dev_present() only checks presence
of a HID in the namespace and does not invoke the _STA control method.
However the code that it replaced also only checked presence in the
namespace, so this is not an issue introduced by my patch but rather
one which was present all along.

If you need to check the "device is present" bit returned by _STA,
you need a pointer to the struct acpi_device. This will allow you
to call acpi_bus_get_status() and check its return value for
ACPI_STA_DEVICE_PRESENT.

We cannot easily add this to acpi_dev_present() because that function
no longer does an expensive namespace walk but rather a cheap list
iteration which does not yield a pointer to the struct acpi_device.

In the first version of acpi_dev_present() I was in fact doing a
namespace walk with acpi_get_devices() but Robert Moore objected
to that, calling it "truly brute force":
http://mailman.alsa-project.org/pipermail/alsa-devel/2015-November/101046.html

Hence if possible you should try to avoid that as well. You may
want to consider adding a helper to drivers/acpi/utils.c which
takes a HID and returns a struct acpi_device*, it might come in
handy for others as well.

Best regards,

Lukas
