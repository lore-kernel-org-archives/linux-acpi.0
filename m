Ok,

lemme split this out into a separate thread and add Tony.

Ok, that kinda makes sense.

But look what our sparse documentation says:

        hest_disable    [ACPI]
                        Disable Hardware Error Source Table (HEST) support;
                        corresponding firmware-first mode error processing
                        logic will be disabled.


and from looking at the code, hest_disable is kinda like the master
switch because it gets evaluated first. Right?

Which sounds to me like we want a generic switch which does:

	apei=disable_ff_notifications

to explicitly do exactly that - disable the firmware-first notification
method. And then the master switch will be

	apei=disable

And we'll be able to pass whatever options here instead of all those
different _disable switches which need lotsa code staring to figure out
what exactly they even do in the first place.

Yeah, and when you boot with ghes_disable, that would say:

	pr_info("HEST: Enabling Firmware First mode for corrected errors.\n");

but there will be no notifications and users will scratch heads.

I don't, frankly. I guess we will have to have a transition period where
we keep them and issue a warning message that users should switch to
"apei=xxx" instead and remove them after a lot of time has passed.

Yes, that makes sense.

But I think we should add a generic cmdline arg with suboptions and
document exactly what all those do. Similar to "mce=" on x86 which is
nicely documented in Documentation/x86/x86_64/boot-options.txt.

Right now, only a few people understand what those do and in some of the
cases they do too much/the wrong thing.

Thoughts?
