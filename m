On Apple machines, plugging-in or unplugging the power triggers a GPE
for the EC. Since these machines expose an SBS device, this GPE ends
up triggering the acpi_sbs_callback(). This in turn tries to get the
status of the SBS charger. However, on MBP13,* and MBP14,* machines,
performing the smbus-read operation to get the charger's status triggers
the EC's GPE again. The result is an endless re-triggering and handling
of that GPE, consuming significant CPU resources (> 50% in irq).

In the end this is quite similar to commit 3031cddea633 (ACPI / SBS:
Don't assume the existence of an SBS charger), except that on the above
machines a status of all 1's is returned. And like there, we just want
ignore the charger here.
