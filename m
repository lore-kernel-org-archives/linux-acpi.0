I don't think we should add a quirk or DMI table yet because we
haven't gotten to the root cause of this problem.  If the root cause
is a problem in the Linux code, adding a quirk will mask the problem
for this specific system, but will leave other systems with similar
problems.

I was hoping to understand this better via the experiment above, but
I'm still confused.  Here's the scenario as I understand it:

  0) fresh boot
  1) e1000e PME_Status should be 0
  2) sleep
  3) wakeup via e1000e succeeds
  4) e1000e PME_Status should be 0
  5) sleep
  6) wakeup via e1000e fails
  7) wakeup via USB succeeds
  8) e1000e PME_Status should be 0, but is actually 1

If I understand correctly, the bugzilla lspci
(https://bugzilla.kernel.org/attachment.cgi?id=280691) was collected
at point 8, and it shows PME_Status=1 when it should be 0.

If we write a 1 to PME_Status to clear it, and it remains set, that's
obviously a hardware defect, and Intel should document that in an
erratum, and a quirk would be the appropriate way to work around it.
But I doubt that's what's happening.

If e1000e changes PME_Status from 0 to 1 and we don't get an interrupt
(in this case, an SCI triggering GPE 0x6d), the problem is something
in the path outside e1000e.  Since the wakeup works the first time, we
know e1000e is *capable* of generating an interrupt, and the problem
is probably something in the way we acknowledge it.

I want to make sure we're executing the code that clears
PCI_PM_CTRL_PME_STATUS.  Would you mind applying the patch below,
turning on CONFIG_ACPI_DEBUG, booting with

  acpi.debug_layer=0x00000004 acpi.debug_level=0x00000004

and collecting the dmesg log?  I think you can also set these debug
flags via /sys/module/acpi/parameters/debug_* if that's easier.
