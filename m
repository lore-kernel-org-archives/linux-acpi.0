Hopefully, yes. But I am not convinced about that yet (see below).

The quirk for the Dell XPS 13 (2015), yes. Once userspace catches up (which
may take _years_). But Matthew was mentioning that "[t]he Inspiron 7437
queries _REV and uses it to modify its EC behaviour, and apparently breaks
on Linux without that." If that is indeed the case, we will need a quirk
for that Inspiron for much, much longer than for the Dell XPS 13 (2015).

Therefore, I see a need to distinguish the quirk for the Dell XPS 13 (2015),
the quirk for the Inspiron 7437 and potential quirks for other systems: Some
may depend on _sound_ userspace being up to date (XPS), some may depend on
_other_ parts of userspace being up to date, and some may be needed for
as long as these systems exist (Inspiron 7437?). And if the userspace for
the XPS is up to date, the quirk for that particular issue may not be needed
any more, while other quirks (such as potentially the one for the 7437) may
still be needed -- that is why I see a need for different CONFIG options.

module_param's aren't unusual in drivers/acpi/* and have substantial
advantages IMO, but I also see the issue of consistency -- so if you really
do prefer __setup, I'll use that approach in the next version of the patch.

I _know_ it's ugly. But this whole suggested change of _REV behavior after
3+ years is ugly, and its fallout may very well be considerably larger than
is known at the moment: It all depends on whether there are other platforms
out there which need such quirks, and whether these quirks are needed for
different timeframes than the quirk for the Dell XPS 13 (2015).

Best,
