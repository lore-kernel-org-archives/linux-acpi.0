So ACPI memory device objects contain all the memory ranges as exported
in E820?

This is confusing. So even if memory hotplug is not supported, ACPI memory
device objects might be present. What's the purpose? How do they help.

If they represent same info as firmware provided using a BIOS call early
(E820 map), then how does system later avoid adding same memory ranges.

IOW, in terms of design, what's the objective. Why to create this
additional path of getting memory information.

But Bao's approach will disable memory hotplug on exactmap.

I am fine with this as long as memmap=exactmap is not the only way to
disable memory hotplug. I need another way too so that users who are
not using exactmap can still disable memory hotplug.

They can always specify no_memory_hotplug, irrespective of the fact that
kernel supports memory hotplug or not.

Anyway, I don't mind if one implicitly disables memory hotplug if
memmap=exactmap or mem=X is specified. It is just a matter of figuring
how what should be a more intutive behavior from user's point of view.

But I do want a separate path to disable memory hotplug so that even 
if I am not using memmap=exactmap or mem=X, I should be able to disable
memory hotplug.

I think creating a new command line option is simpler as compared to
creating a new flag in bootparam which in turn disables memory hotplug.
More users can use that option. For example, if for some reason hotplug
code is crashing, one can just disable it on command line as work around
and move on.
