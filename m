Before v8.2 we assumed these were fatal for the thread, it couldn't make progress.
Since v8.2 we get a value from the CPU, the severity values are, (the flippant
summary is obviously mine!):
* Recoverable: "You're about to step in it, fix it or die"
* Uncontainable: "It was here, but it escaped, we dont know where it went, panic!"
* Restartable/Corrected: "its fine, pretend this didn't happen"

Firmware should duplicate these values into the CPER severity fields.

If we miss MF_ACTION_REQUIRED, the page still gets unmapped from user-space, and
user-space gets an AO signal. With this patch it takes that signal before it
continues. If it ignores it, the access gets a translation-fault->EHWPOISON->AR
signal from the arch code.

... so missing the flag gives us an extra signal. I'm not convinced this results
in any observable difference.

The options are those 'aborts' in the memory error. These must have been a
result of some request. If we get a CPU error structure as part of the same
block, it may have a cache/bus error structure, which has a precise bit that
tells us whether this is a co-incidence. (but linux doesn't support any of those
structures today)



Thanks,

James
