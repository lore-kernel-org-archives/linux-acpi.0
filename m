>>> I think it would be better to keep this similar to the naming of the current RAS trace events (right now we have mc_event, arm_event, aer_event, etc.). I would suggest using "arm_err_info_event" since this is handling the error information structures of the arm errors.

Yes, true...I guess we really don't need the validation bits then.

>>> I think the "ARM Processor Error:" part of this should just be removed. Here's the output with this removed and the trace event renamed to arm_err_info_event. I think this looks much cleaner and matches the style used with the arm_event.

> As this section is ARM Processor Error Section, how about use arm_proc_err_event?
This is not for the ARM Processor Error Section, that is what the 
arm_event is handling. What you are adding this trace support for here 
is called the ARM Processor Error Information (UEFI 2.6 spec section 
N.2.4.4.1). So I think your trace event here should be called 
arm_err_info_event. This will also be consistent with the other two 
trace events that I'm planning on adding:

arm_ctx_info_event: ARM Processor Context Information (UEFI 2.6 section 
N.2.4.4.2)
arm_vendor_info_event: This is the "Vendor Specific Error Information" 
in the ARM Processor Error Section (Table 260). It's possible I may just 
add this into the arm_event trace event, but I haven't looked into it 
enough yet.

Thanks,
Tyler
