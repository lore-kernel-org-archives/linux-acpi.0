Hmmm, I'd forgotten about the extra flags. They're only used by x86's
do_machine_check(), which knows more about what is going on. I agree we do know
it should be a 'MF_ACTION_REQUIRED' for Synchronous-external-abort, but I'd
really like all the notifications to behave in the same way as we can't change
which notification firmware uses.
(This ghes_is_synchronous() affects when memory_failure() runs, not what it does.)

What happens if we miss MF_ACTION_REQUIRED? Surely the page still gets unmapped
as its PG_Poisoned, an AO signal may be pending, but if user-space touches the
page it will get an AR signal. Is this just about removing an extra AO signal to
user-space?

If we do need this, I'd like to pick it up from the CPER records, as x86's
NOTIFY_NMI looks like it covers both AO/AR cases. (as does NOTIFY_SDEI). The
Master/Target abort or Invalid-address types in the memory-error-section CPER
records look like the best bet.

What would we do if it fails? The reasons look fairly broad, -EBUSY can mean
"(page) still referenced by [..] users", 'thp split failed' or 'page already
poisoned'. I don't think the behaviour or return-codes are consistent enough to use.

We don't do this today. If it fixes some mis-behaviour, and we can key it from
something in the CPER records then I'm all ears!


Thanks,

James
