I guess this is the bit of information I was missing.

Ok, this sounds like the polled case. FW better have a record ready
before raising the NMI.

Thanks for the comic relief. :-P

Oh the fun.

Nah, I was simply trying to figure out why we do that buf_paddr check.
Thanks for the extensive clarification.
