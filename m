If this is a motherboard issue or platform specific, do you prefer to use
DMI matches here?

As for _PRW, it’s shared by USB controller, Audio controller and ethernet.
Only the ethernet (e1000e) has this issue.

When this issue happens, the e1000e doesn’t get woken up by ethernet cable
plugging, but inserting a USB device or plugging audio jack can wake up all
three devices. So I think Linux interprets ACPI correctly here.

Their _PRW here:
USB controller:
    Scope (_SB.PCI0)                       
    {                                      
        Device (XDCI)                            
        {                    
            Method (_PRW, 0, NotSerialized)  // _PRW: Power Resources for Wake
            {            
                Return (GPRW (0x6D, 0x04))
            } 

Audio controller:
Scope (_SB.PCI0)                                                                                           
    {                                                                                                          
        Device (HDAS)                                  
        {                                                                             
            …         
            Method (_PRW, 0, NotSerialized)  // _PRW: Power Resources for Wake                 
            {                                        
                Return (GPRW (0x6D, 0x04))           
            }                                  

Ethernet controller:
    Scope (_SB.PCI0)                                                                     
    {                                                                     
        Device (GLAN)                                                  
        {                                                                            
           …
            Method (_PRW, 0, NotSerialized)  // _PRW: Power Resources for Wake                 
            {                                        
                Return (GPRW (0x6D, 0x04))                       
            }                                                              
        }                                                             
    }
