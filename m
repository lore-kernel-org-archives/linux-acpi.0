This question seems to be not really related to the review
comment that it is responding to.

(1) If the host does not support notifying us about
errors, then there is clearly nothing to do in this
code, because we will never get a notification.

(2) If the host does support notifying us about errors,
but we choose not to expose RAS to the guest, then
there's not much to do either. We probably just want
to take whatever the default behaviour is for any
application when it touches memory that's bad.
We definitely don't want to tell the guest anything.

(3) If the host supports notification, and we choose
to expose RAS to the guest, then we need to do
whatever we have to do to notify the guest.

If we're in this signal handler and also
arm_feature(env, ARM_FEATURE_RAS) is false then that
is case (2), and my point is that doing anything with
the guest 'syndrome' value looks like the wrong thing.
