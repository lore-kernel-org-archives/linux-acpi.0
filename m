Right, it needs the userspace configuration files installing.

As previously advised that firmware is optional.

Does this also affect other behaviour of the system?  I'd be pretty
unhappy if it introduce power regressions for example, I mostly don't use
audio on my laptops but I care a lot about how long it'll run
disconnected.  It *is* quite a new laptop and my experience installing
was very much that it was in bringup (though quite a bit of this was
userspace).
