This is actually somewhat confusing issue. I think it's relatively easy 
to switch using ACPI names within ASoC core (by modifying 
fmt_single_name or something like that).

Problem is that for ACPI enumerated client devices the dev_name(dev) 
still comes from those subsystems as before. So for instance dev_ prints 
in codec driver or ASoC core keeps printing "rt5640 0-001c:" as before 
and I personally find it a bit more confusing if internal ASoC names 
don't match as easily with dev_ prints.

But yes, I agree. This alias name in DAI link is not that clear either 
as it exists only during bind time.
