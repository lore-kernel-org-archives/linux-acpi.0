Which doesn't explain why we need a config option per quirk.  To me, su=
ch config
options don't add any value, because (a) everyone will set them anyway =
and (b)
removing the quirks from the source is trivial if needed.

In this file I prefer __setup.

It was done in response to active abuse and things would have broken an=
yway
after adding ACPI 6 support to ACPICA (if the spec hadn't changed the
interpretation of _REV return values).
