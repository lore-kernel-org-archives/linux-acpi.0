The idea is not about the code savings, but about having a simple way t=
o disable
the whole thing entirely at one point.

All of the workarounds under this option *including* the command line s=
witch
should be temporary.

I'm not sure if we need a config option for Dell in particular.  We can=
 simply
drop the quirk when it is not necessary any more.

Because it is consistent with the other __setup things done in this fil=
e
(and none of them is a module_param, mind you).

Nope.  And I said why above.

I'm still not seeing the point and this is just !@#$%^&*()_+ ugly.
