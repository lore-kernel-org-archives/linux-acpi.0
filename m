Ripping out the existing #ifdefs and replacing them with IS_ENABLED() would let
the compiler work out the estatus stuff is unused, and saves us describing the
what-uses-it logic in Kconfig.

But this does expose the x86 nmi stuff on arm64, which doesn't build today.
Dragging NMI_HANDLED and friends up to the 'linux' header causes a fair amount
of noise under arch/x86 (include the new header in 22 files). Adding dummy
declarations to arm64 fixes this, and doesn't affect the other architectures
that have an asm/nmi.h

Alternatively we could leave {un,}register_nmi_handler() under
CONFIG_HAVE_ACPI_APEI_NMI. I think we need to keep the NOTIFY_NMI kconfig symbol
around, as its one of the two I can't work out how to fix without the TLBI-IPI.


Thanks,

James
