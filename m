Yeah, known issue. We dealt with that on x86 at the time:

d4812e169de4 ("x86, mce: Get rid of TIF_MCE_NOTIFY and associated mce tricks")

Whoops. Yeah, I was about to paste this:

void mce_log(struct mce *m)
{
        if (!mce_gen_pool_add(m))
                irq_work_queue(&mce_irq_work);
}

we're basically queueing only into the lockless buffer and kicking the
IRQ work.

Well, #MC is basically an NMI context on x86 and when it is done, we
work through the items queued in process context. But see the commit
above too - for really urgent errors we run memory_failure *before* we
return to user.

Sounds very similar.

Actually, yours is even a bit more elegant. I wonder why we didn't use
task_work_add() then...

Thx.
