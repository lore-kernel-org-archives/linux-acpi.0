I can apply patches in this series up to and including patch [21/26].

Do you want me to do that?

Patch [22/26] requires an ACK from mm people.

Patch [23/26] has a problem that randconfig can generate a configuration
in which memory_failure_queue_kick() is not present, so it is necessary
to add a CONFIG_MEMORY_FAILURE dependency somewhere for things to
work (or define an empty stub for that function in case the symbol is
not set).

If patches [24-26/26] don't depend on the previous two, I can try to
apply them either, so please let me know.

Thanks,
Rafael
