Is it just configuration files?  With 4.1-rc3 I've not been able to get sound working mucking with any mixers.

The errors in dmesg make it seem like that was related to the firmware missing, but that is a red herring it sounds like.

I just tried it with 4.1-rc3 from Ubuntu's mainline PPA and an Ubuntu 15.04 userspace.  It does affect the behavior of the system.    See all the PCM errors in dmesg:
https://bugzilla.kernel.org/attachment.cgi?id=176511

At least with BIOS A03 (latest), Ubuntu 15.04 (3.19ish and modern userspace) or with 4.0 and recent userspace the experience shouldn't be bringup.

Keyon,

There is a bug opened at https://bugzilla.kernel.org/show_bug.cgi?id=93361.  I've added updated notes to this for 4.1-rc3 experience.
