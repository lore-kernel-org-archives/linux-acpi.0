Great, I didn't miss something nasty...

What do we mean by 'hardware' here? We're receiving a corrupt report of
something via memory.
The GHESv2 ack just means we're done with the memory. I think it exists because
the external-agent can't peek into the CPU to see if its returned from the
notification.

Sorry, that will be due to my bad description.

Is there anything wrong with what we do today? We stamp on the records so that
we don't processes them again. (especially if is polled), and we tell firmware
it can re-use this memory.

(I think we should return an error, or print a ratelimited warning for corrupt
records)

I think this duplicates the record-stamping/acking. If there is anything in that
memory region, the action for processed/copied/ignored-because-its-corrupt is
the same.

We can return on ENOENT out earlier, as nothing needs doing in that case. Its
what the GHES_TO_CLEAR spaghetti is for, we can probably move the ack thing into
ghes_clear_estatus(), that way that thing means 'I'm done with this memory'.

Something like:
-------------------------
rc = ghes_read_estatus();
if (rc == -ENOENT)
	return 0;

if (!rc) {
	ghes_do_proc() and friends;
}

ghes_clear_estatus();

return rc;
-------------------------

We would no longer return errors from the ack code, I suspect that can only
happen for a corrupt gas, which we would have caught earlier as we rely on the
mapping being cached.



Thanks,

James
