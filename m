It's the 'unnecessary handling when CONFIG_ACPI_APEI_SEI' in the commit message
that confuses me: this patch doesn't reference that Kconfig symbol. I guess that
sentence needs removing for this v6?

Re-reading without that part of the commit-message:

You're relying on the compiler's dead-code elimination to spot unused static
functions and silently drop them. Great!
(there is the small risk that gcc 3.2[0] can't do this, x86 still has to support
this gcc version)

As this is just clean-up patch can you break it out of this series, it isn't
needed to add support for SEI.

(This series adds support for what should be an APEI notification, but the only
code that touches APEI removes some code from a different notification method.)

(Yes, I saw that in v5 and expected this series to add some APEI support code )

'not accurate'... this is going to be a problem, but lets keep that discussion
on the cover-letter.

Sure, but I only see this cleanup patch in this series, where does APEI learn
about NOTIFY_SEI? As this is nothing will ever touch those CPER records, if
you're using GHESv2 firmware will be prevented from delivering subsequent
notifications.


Thanks,

James
