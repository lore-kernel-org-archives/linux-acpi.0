So that APEI doesn't need to know which lock goes with which fixmap page, and
how these notifications interact.

NOTIFY_NMI is x86's NMI, arm doesn't have anything that behaves in the same way,
so doesn't use it. The equivalent notifications with NMI-like behaviour are:
* SEA (synchronous external abort)
* SEI (SError Interrupt)
* SDEI (software delegated exception interface)

Today we could, but once we have SDEI and SEI this won't work:
SDEI behaves as two notifications, 'normal' and 'critical', a different fixmap
page is needed for these as they can interrupt each other, and a different lock.

SEA can interrupt SEI, so they need a different fixmap-pages and locks.
We can always disable SEI when we're handling another NMI-like notification.

I doubt anyone would implement all three, but if they did SEA can interrupt the lot.


I'd like to avoid describing any of these interactions in ghes.c, I think it
should be possible that any notification can interrupt any other notification
without the risk of deadlock.

I wanted to avoid duplicating that list, some of the locks are #ifdef'd so it
gets ugly quickly. (We would only need the NMI-like notifications though).

I'd really like to avoid the GHES code having to know about normal/critical SDEI
events.


Alternatively, I can put the fixmap-page and spinlock in some 'struct
ghes_notification' that only the NMI-like struct-ghes need. This is just moving
the indirection up a level, but it does pair the lock with the thing it locks,
and gets rid of assigning spinlock pointers.


Thanks,

James
