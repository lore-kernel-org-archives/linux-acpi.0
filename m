I don't think this is the best way of solving the interaction problem. If we
ever need to add another notification method this gets even more complicated,
and the ioremap code has to know how these methods can interact.

I think this one should be a raw_spin_lock. I'm pretty sure this is for RT-linux
where spin_lock() on a contented lock will call schedule() in the same way
mutex_lock() does. If interrupts were masked by arch code then you need to use
raw_spin_lock.
So now we need to know how we got in here, we interrupted the SError handler so
this should only be Synchronous External Abort. Having to know how we got here
is another problem with this approach.


As suggested earlier[0], I think the best way is to allocate one page of virtual
address space per struct ghes, and move the locks out to the notify calls, which
can know how they are called.

I've pushed a branch to:
http://www.linux-arm.org/git?p=linux-jm.git;a=commit;h=refs/heads/apei_ioremap_rework/v1

I intend to post those patches as an RFC series later in the cycle, I've only
build tested it so far.


Thanks,

James
