Strictly speaking these are CPER records in a memory region pointed to by the
HEST->GHES ACPI table.

What happens if you took an SError from EL2 and EL2 has PSTATE.A set masking
SError? (this is very common today: all kernel code runs like this).

What happens if the hypervisor then executes an ESB with PSTATE.A set? It
expects to see any pending SError deferred and its syndrome written to DISR_EL1,
but this register is RAZ/WI when you set SCR_EL3.EA. '4.4.2' of [0]

KVM can't parse the CPER records, nor does it know where to look to find them.
KVM should call out to the APEI code so the host kernel can handle the error.

User-space may be signalled by the memory_failure() helper, and user-space may
choose to notify the guest about the memory-failure, but this would be a new error.

This looks like a firmware bug, what address do you get in your CPER records? It
should be a physical address.

To report a memory-error you must have an address.

If the error wasn't detected as a synchronous access then delivering a
synchronous-external-abort is inappropriate (I think we both agree on this), and
SError-interrupt doesn't have a way of specifying an address ... but the CPER
records do.

For firmware-first your SError-interrupt is just a notification, its the CPER
records the OS uses to handle the error.

What do you mean by propagated?

I don't think we should ever hand RAS notifications to user-space, the host
kernel should handle them, then describe the symptom (e.g. this region of your
va space is gone) to user-space.
