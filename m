Since there's no way to get this working without using new userspace,
we're basically stuck with having to support _REV 5. And since we're
supposed to support old userspace basically forever, this isn't going
to be something that we can just remove in a few months. But since the
hardware is intended to be used in I2S mode, we don't want this quirk
to be there forever. So we're basically left with adding
CONFIG_ACPI_WORKAROUND_BROKEN_DELLS which enables the quirk, default
it to Y and then let distributions set it to N when they've got
sufficiently new userspace. Unless someone has a better plan?
