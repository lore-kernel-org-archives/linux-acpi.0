After this patch user-space can trigger an SError in the guest. If it wants to
migrate the guest, how does the pending SError get migrated?

I think we need to fix migration first. Andrew Jones suggested using
KVM_GET/SET_VCPU_EVENTS:
https://www.spinics.net/lists/arm-kernel/msg616846.html

Given KVM uses kvm_inject_vabt() on v8.0 hardware too, we should cover systems
without the v8.2 RAS Extensions with the same API. I think this means a bit to
read/write whether SError is pending, and another to indicate the ESR should be
set/read.
CPUs without the v8.2 RAS Extensions can reject pending-SError that had an ESR.

user-space can then use the 'for migration' calls to make a 'new' SError pending.

Now that the cpufeature bits are queued, I think this can be split up into two
separate series for v4.16-rc1, one to tackle NOTIFY_SEI and the associated
plumbing. The second for the KVM 'make SError pending' API.

Does nothing in the patch that adds the support? This is a bit odd.
(oh, its hiding in patch 6...)


Thanks,
