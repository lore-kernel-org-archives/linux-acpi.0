acpiphp: Identify more removable slots
    
    According to section 6.3.6 of the ACPI spec, the presence of an _RMV
    method that evaluates to 1 is sufficient to indicate that a slot is
    removable without needing an eject method. This patch refactors the
    ejectable slot detection code a little in order to flag these slots as
    ejectable and register them. Acpihp therefore binds to the expresscard
    slot on my HP test machine.

this makes acpiphp handle hotplug of (now one, sd reader is somehow
always present) card reader.
