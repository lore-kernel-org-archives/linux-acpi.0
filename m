This quirk applies to all 0x15bb (E1000_DEV_ID_PCH_CNP_I219_LM7) and
0x15bd (E1000_DEV_ID_PCH_CNP_I219_LM6) devices.  The e1000e driver
claims about a zillion different device IDs.

I would be surprised if these two devices are defective but all the
others work correctly.  Could it be that there is a problem with the
wiring on this particular motherboard or with the ACPI _PRW methods
(or the way Linux interprets them) in this firmware?

Would you mind attaching a complete dmesg log and "sudo lspci -vvv"
output to the bugzilla, please?
