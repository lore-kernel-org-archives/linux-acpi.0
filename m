ghes_disable lets you ignore the firmware-first notifications, but still 'use'
the other error sources:
drivers/pci/pcie/aer.c picks out the three AER types, and uses apei_hest_parse()
to know if firmware is controlling AER, even if ghes_disable is set.

x86's arch_apei_enable_cmcff() looks like it disables MCE to get firmware to
handle them. hest_disable would stop this, but instead ghes_disable keeps that,
and stops the NOTIFY_NMI being registered.

(do you consider cmdline arguments as ABI, or hard to justify and hard to remove?)

I don't think its broken enough to justify ripping them out. A user of
ghes_disable would be someone with broken firmware-first handling of AER. They
need to know firmware is changing the register values behind their back (so need
to parse the HEST), but want to ignore the junk notifications. It doesn't sound
like an unlikely scenario.

Right, yes. I've been ignoring errors like this on the probe path as it implies
you've got busted ACPI tables, or so little memory you're never going to make it
to user-space. I was more worried about ghes_probe() trying to use the pool
memory before its been allocated. I doesn't seem right to register the device if
the driver wouldn't work yet. But one is an subsys_initcall(), the drivers is
device_initcall(), which is obvious enough.

Fixed.


Thanks,

James
