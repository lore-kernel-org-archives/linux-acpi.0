Yes, it is.

Yes, it is.

Currently we does not consider much about the mask status(SPSR).
I remember that you ever suggested firmware should reboot if the mask status is set(SPSR), right?
I ever suggest our firmware team to evaluate that, but there is no response.

I CC "liu jun" <liujun88@hisilicon.com> who is our UEFI firmware Architect, if you have firmware requirements, you can
raise again.

I know your meaning, thanks for raising it again.

I will rename 'external modules' to other name. Thanks.
