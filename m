Sorry about that, I've adjusted my mail client settings.

These are the different flows supported and what changes in the 
different flows.
This is up to date as of BIOS A03:

When Linux is detected (_OSI Windows 2013 & _REV 5):
* EC configures the audio controller for HDA mode on next cold boot.
* HDA audio device is included in PCI address space.
* Touchpad is put into I2C mode.

When Windows 8.1 is detected or currently Linux 4.1 (_OSI Windows 2013 & 
_REV 2):
* EC configures the audio controller for I2S mode on next cold boot.
* ADSP audio device included in ACPI (INT3438).
* Touchpad is put in I2C mode.

When Windows 7 is detected (_OSI Windows 2009):
* EC configures the audio controller for HDA mode on the next cold boot.
* HDA audio device included in PCI address space.
* Touchpad is put in PS2 mode.

linux-firmware ubuntu 15.04 version: 1.143.
