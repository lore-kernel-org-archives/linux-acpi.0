If somebody (eg. me) doesn't want to build in the entire code associated with
that stuff at all, the config option making it go away is actually useful.
Conversely, if you know you need at least one of the quirks or the command line
switch, building in it all is not a big deal.

I just want to avoid unnecessary proliferation of config options that's going
to result from that if we start to add them per quirk.

I guess the Matthew's point is that distros would not need to patch their
kernels to remove quirks if we added these config options to the mainline,
but quite frankly I don't see much difference in this particular case.
