Nit: when re-posting patches from the list you need to add your signed-off-by.
See Documentation/process/submitting-patches.rst 'Developer's Certificate of
Origin 1.1'

This goes for your patch 2 as well.

This patch was sitting on top of the SError rework. As the cover-letter
describes that was all there to make sure SError is unmasked when we execute
this esb(). Without it any pending SError will be deferred, its ESR is written
to DISR_EL1, which this patch doesn't check.

On its own, this patch is actively harmful to systems that don't have
firmware-first handling.

We probably need to produce a combined series...


Thanks,

James
