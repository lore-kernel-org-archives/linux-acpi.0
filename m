Ok, I have fan*_* and temp*_input hanging directly from the device (no
groups).  However, that device has a lot of other stuff that is not even
remotely accounted for in hwmon, such as control of video outputs and
hotkeys, the firmware action beeper, etc.

Does that cause problems for lm-sensors, or would it just ignore the extra
attributes and groups?

I can provide two devices, ibm-acpi.0 and ibm-acpi.1, and have the hwmon
attributes in only one of them, and register just that one with the hwmon
class.  Would that be better/safer?
