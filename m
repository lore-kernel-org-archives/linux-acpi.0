Thanks for the detailed analysis!

Right, so I'm thinking a lot simpler: allocate a pool which should
be large enough to handle all situations and drop all that logic
which recomputes and reallocates pool size. Just a static thing which
JustWorks(tm).

For a couple of reasons:

 - you state it above: all those synchronization issues are gone with a
 prellocated pool

 - 64K per-GHES pool is nothing if you consider the machines this thing
 runs on - fat servers with lotsa memory. And RAS there *is* important.
 And TBH 64K is nothing even on a small client sporting gigabytes of
 memory.

 - code is a lot simpler and cleaner - you don't need all that pool
 expanding and shrinking. I mean, I'm all for smarter solutions if they
 have any clear advantages warranting the complication but this is a
 lot of machinery just so that we can save a couple of KBs. Which, as a
 whole, sounds just too much to me.

But this is just me.
