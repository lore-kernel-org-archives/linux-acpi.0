... and presumably your firmware generates a fake-Synchronous-external-abort to
hand to EL2 as an APEI SEA notification? My point: this is fine, KVM already
handles synchronous-external aborts, no more work needed for this trap, (in
contrast to the TERR, which you've fixed)

HCR_EL3!?!

Thanks. Software has the bad habit of living much longer than we think, if KVM
traps part of the architecture then we have to emulate it... Some bright spark
might boot a future Linux-v4.42 guest on a Linux-v4.16 host.

I had a run through the RAS spec: if we make ERRIDR_EL1 RAZ/WI then we can do
the same with ERRSELR_EL1. Then following the rules for 'If ERRSELR_EL1.SEL is
[>=]  ERRIDR_EL1.NUM' that makes the ERX* registers RAZ/WI too.

Thanks,
