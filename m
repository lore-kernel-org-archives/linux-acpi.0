Well, this approach works as well -- limiting it to an override for just 5
seems reasonable; expanding blacklist.c to also cover this case (even though
it's not a blacklisting per se) isn't worth any discussion.

Nonetheless, a few specifics:

> +config ACPI_REV_OVERRIDE_POSSIBLE

Why should that be a config option at all? The code savings should be
really, really tiny; and especially in the beginning we might see a few
machines where testing the override might seem to be a good idea. So I'd
favour having the command line optional, and then only specific quirks
behind a config option: For the Dell XPS 13 it makes sense to disable the
quirk if userspace can manage i2s sound; for other systems, there may not be
such hope. And as this is a machine-specific decision, I fear that we have
to do CONFIG options for each and every such DMI entry.

Why __setup, and not module_param? Should mean a smaller diffstat...

So, here's what I'd do based on your modification:

[PATCH] acpi: override to set _REV, especially on Dell XPS 13 (2015)

By using a module parameter named acpi.override_rev=3D1, the BIOS
may be told a different supported ACPI revision compared to the default
(which currently is 5, but will be modified to 2 when the revert of
b1ef29725865 is reverted).

Such an override is needed, for example, on a Dell XPS 13 (2015):
Based on what ACPI exports as is supported version (_REV), the firmware
configures the audio device to either work in HDA mode or in I2S mode.
As the latter only works on sufficiently new userspace, add a quirk and
an associated config option to force sound to HDA mode.
