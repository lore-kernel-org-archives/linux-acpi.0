Just to be clear, from the Dell side only the XPS 13 9343 has this _REV 
behavior.

What's wrong with a DMI quirk until I2S is mature on the kernel side and 
userspace is new enough in distros?  Is it too early in boot for DMI 
quirks?  That would enforce that no other machines can use _REV value of 
5 to detect Linux without breaking the 9343.
