Before patch 4, this was behind CONFIG_HAVE_ACPI_APEI_NMI, (so it made use of an
existing kconfig symbol), and there was only one user x86:NMI.

The ACPI spec has four ~NMI notifications, so far the support for these in Linux
has been selectable separately. If you build the kernel without any of them then
this code would be unused, and generate warnings because all those users are
behind #ifdef too.

I'm all in favour of letting the compiler work it out, but the existing ghes
code has #ifdef/#else all over the place. This is 'keeping the style'.
I assumed it was done this way to support an older compiler on x86, (I see that
jumped from 3.2 to 4.6 with commit cafa0010cd51)

We could strip the lot away to a few IS_ENABLED() in ghes_probe() and the
memory_failure()/AER calls if you'd prefer.


Thanks,

James
