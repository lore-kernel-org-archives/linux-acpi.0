Okay, I would suggest that a module parameter could be set by userspace, 
but I remember now that it is usually built in the kernel instead. Also, it 
could be bad having this set for the whole system, instead of per-VM.

How do you suggest letting userspace control that?
(All I could think was using an ioctl / API of any sorts, which would 
require changing the VMMs as well.)

LOL

Fair enough... it was tested in qemu live migration, and it works properly 
(migrated from 2 instances of qemu in the same host, emulated by model).

I agree that's a more interesting test.

The terms are indeed confusing, but HACDBS is just the cleaning accelerator 
for dirty-bit. It means it will only affect how long it takes to transverse 
the page table making pages in the array writable-dirty -> writable-clean.

That being said, it regards to efficiency:
Well, as I only have the model to test that, I am limmited to those 
results, which may not reflect reality.

As an example, on dirty_log_perf_test, the cleaning process took much 
longer (8x) compared to software cleaning, even when faced with no error, 
and entries that fit the array (4k page above). If it took that long even 
in this ideal scenario, it means the HACDBS mechanism implemented in the 
model takes much longer than software, which is counter-intuitive.

Sure, I will try measuring migration between 2 instances of the model, and 
see how qemu live migration time is affected, then post the results in this 
thread for us to compare.

Thanks!
