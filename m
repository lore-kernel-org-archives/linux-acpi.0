Debian jessie. Therefore, commit b1ef29725865 does cause a regression (even
though it's just a side effect): the Dell XPS 13 (2013) works just fine with
a standard Debian jessie install and a current kernel. Sound worked fine
until commit b1ef29725865 / works fine with commit b1ef29725865 reverted.

New kernels should continue to work on (reasonably) old userspace; and
currently I do not see how this can be made to work with commit=20
b1ef29725865 and no quirk / override. As soon as I find the time for that,
I'll try to create a patch for that -- unless someone beats me to that.

Well, sound _is_ quite important to me; and as stated above, the laptop
works just fine otherwise on Debian jessie (well, except the WiFi adapter,
but that's another story).

Best,
