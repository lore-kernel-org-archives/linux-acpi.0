OK, here's a deal.

I'll wait for the next few days for someone to tell me if there's any
known system in addition to the XPS 13 (2015) which breaks as a result
of the change to return 2 from _REV.  If none are reported before the
next Friday, I'll just apply the patch I posted some time ago.  If any
reports come in later, we'll still be able to rearrange things during
the 4.2 cycle or even later.

If *something* is reported next week, I'll reconsider the approach depending
on what that thing is.
