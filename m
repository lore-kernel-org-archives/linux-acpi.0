Spreading 'current discussion' over two versions is a problem for anyone trying
to follow this series.

If you post a newer version its normal for people to delete the older versions.
When you post a new version you should be happy that its the latest and greatest.

You may be able to share some of the code, but I don't think you should share
the list of GHES between notification methods.
This leads to races between the firmware and OS: If CPU-A has received an SEI
firmware would have to avoid generating an SEA on CPU-B as the SEI-handler
running on CPU-A may find and process the second set of CPER records. CPU-B then
gets a spurious notification.

Why is this a problem? KVM needs to know if APEI handled the error, or whether
the Synchronous-External-Abort/SError-Interrupt was due to something else, in
which case we invoke todays default behaviour, which isn't appropriate for a RAS
event.


Thanks,

James
