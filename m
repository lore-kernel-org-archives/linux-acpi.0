Will do.

I think it actually does make sense to use "%*pbl" format here. The
type we're displaying is a bit array, so this is one value for that
attribute. There are many precedents for disapling bit arrays this
way. The existing node attributes that we're appending to show cpu
lists, and the top loevel shows node lists for "possible", "online",
"has_memory", "has_cpu". This new attribute should fit well with
exisiting similar attributes from this subsystem.

I think that makes sense, I'll take try out this suggestion.
