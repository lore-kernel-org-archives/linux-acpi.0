and here is where I was wrong: I was only looking at reading the data, we then
dump it in struct ghes assuming it can only be notified on once CPU at a time. Oops.

Yup, thanks for the example!

NOTIFY_SEA is synchronous so the error has to be something to do with the
instruction that was interrupted. In your example this would mean the APEI
code/data was corrupted, which there is little point trying to handle.

NOTIFY_{SEI, SDEI} on the other hand are asynchronous, so this could happen.

... I need to go through this thing again to work out how the firmware-buffers
map on to estatus=>ghes ...

The whole in_nmi()=>other-lock think looks like a hack to make a warning go
away. We could get the notification to take whatever lock is appropriate further
out, but it may mean some code duplication. (I'll put it on my list...)


Thanks,
