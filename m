Good question.

I'm guessing all those things should be queued on a normal struct
work_struct queue, no?

Now, memory_failure_queue() does that and can run from IRQ context so
you need only an irq_work which can queue from NMI context. We do it
this way in the MCA code:

We queue in an irq_work in NMI context and work through the items in
process context.

Can we avoid that GFP_ATOMIC allocation and kfree() in
ghes_kick_memory_failure()?

I mean, that struct ghes_memory_failure_work is small enough and we
already do lockless allocation:

	estatus_node = (void *)gen_pool_alloc(ghes_estatus_pool, node_len);

so I guess we could add that ghes_memory_failure_work struct to that
estatus_node, hand it into ghes_do_proc() and then free it.

No?
