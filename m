It shouldn't be possible, these are just to give the compiler something int
shaped to work with, until it prunes all the callers.

But for arm64, yes if would fail. -1 shouldn't alias an existing entry, and it
will get caught by:
| BUG_ON(idx <= FIX_HOLE || idx >= __end_of_fixed_addresses);

I wanted BUILD_BUG_ON() here, as any user of these should be optimised out, but
the compiler choked on that.

__end_of_fixed_addresses would be a better arch-agnostic invalid value. It has
to be defined as the last value in the enum for core code's fix_to_virt() to work.


These two look like something left behind from when we had different #ifdeffery.
The users of these two are now behind arch specific #ifdefs that since patch 12
of this series, can't be turned off, so I can remove these.

We do need them for SDEI, as it is relying on IS_ENABLED() and the compiler's
dead code elimination. But the compiler wants that symbol to have the right type
before it gets that far.


|#define FIX_APEI_GHES_SDEI_NORMAL      (BUILD_BUG(), -1)

Was the best I had, but this trips the BUILD_BUG() too early.
With it, x86 BUILD_BUG()s. With just the -1 the path gets pruned out, and there
are no 'sdei' symbols in the object file.

...at this point, I stopped caring!

We already skip registering notifiers if the kconfig option wasn't selected.

We can't catch this at compile time, as the dead-code elimination seems to
happen in multiple passes.

I'll switch the SDEI ones to __end_of_fixed_addresses, as both architectures
BUG() when they see this.


Thanks,

James
