Having dug into this deeper with you on the other thread, battery 
detection already wasn't working.
That machine did the _REV test and fix for Linux only on Windows 2009 
_OSI and the _REV value of 5.
The kernel currently responds to a later _OSI that the machine supports 
so that AML does not get run.

I believe battery detection may be fixed on that Inspiron by 
75646e758a0ecbed5024454507d5be5b9ea9dcbf.
if it's not, that's a tangential problem that should be fixed to match 
the Windows behavior for battery detection.
