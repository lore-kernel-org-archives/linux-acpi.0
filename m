Dominik,

Yes I've noticed it's acting much worse for me too with 4.1-rc2 on Ubuntu 15.04 userspace (which is quite new indeed).  I really think the right solution is some sort of quirk against the XPS 13 on the _REV behavior until this is reasonably mature.

OT: Yes, this feedback has been taken to heart by the team.  We're working on adding more variants with alternate adapters.  :)
